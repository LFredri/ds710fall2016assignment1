2. Why are you interested in Data Science?
	I've always enjoyed working with data and thought this would be the perfect program for me.
3. Tell us a little bit about your programming experience.  What programming courses have you taken?  Do you use programming on the job, and if so, how?
	I took java in my undergrad program.  Since then I've worked with SQL at my job.
4.  Tell us a little bit about your statistics experience.  What statistics courses have you taken?  Do you use statistics on the job, and if so, how?

7.  Is there anything else you would like to share with us?
	I look forward to the new material I will learn in this class and expect that I'll be able to use it directly with my day-to-day work at my job.
